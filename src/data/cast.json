Born and raised in California, Cassandra discovered the power of combining these interests while performing first-person historical interpretations at Ardenwood Historic Park. Over the years, she has pursued these passions separately, earning a bachelor's degree in history and also LARPing for the past decade. Now, she is excited to bring them together again. Cassandra traded the California sunshine for the moody Pacific Northwest 15 years ago, eventually settling in Washington state. Day to day, she can be found raising a tiny human with her husband, volunteering with her local Pride group, experimenting in the kitchen, and enjoying a good book (usually at the same time, thanks to audiobooks). Cassandra looks forward to exploring more voice acting and narration opportunities in the future.",
