Born and raised in California, Cassandra discovered the power of combining these interests while performing first-person historical interpretations at Ardenwood Historic Park. Over the years, she has pursued these passions separately, earning a bachelor's degree in history and also LARPing for the past decade. Now, she is excited to bring them together again. Cassandra traded the California sunshine for the moody Pacific Northwest 15 years ago, eventually settling in Washington state. Day to day, she can be found raising a tiny human with her husband, volunteering with her local Pride group, experimenting in the kitchen, and enjoying a good book (usually at the same time, thanks to audiobooks). Cassandra looks forward to exploring more voice acting and narration opportunities in the future.",

Zephyr grew up along Stevens Pass, where the story is set, so getting to be part of something spooky in his own backyard feels extra special. Zephyr comes from a background in theatre, writing, and LARP, and he has always loved stepping into character. Voice acting has been a dream of his for years, and he is beyond excited (and maybe a little scared) to finally bring that to life in Dark Northwest.",
